# RJ Crypto Alert v1.0 Beta

**Welcome!** RJ Crypto Alert is a Windows desktop application designed to track cryptocurrency price changes and provide alerts for significant movements.

**Note:** This application is currently in **Beta**. This means you might encounter some bugs or features might not work exactly as expected. Your feedback is highly valuable for improving the application!

## Current Features (v1.0 Beta)

    * Option to manually enter a symbol for coins not in the pre-loaded list.
* **Multi-Coin Tracking:** Track multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously, displayed in a card-based view showing symbol, current price, last update time, previous price, and percentage change.

    * Prices for all tracked cryptocurrencies are automatically refreshed from the CoinMarketCap API at regular intervals.
    * The refresh interval is user-configurable (1-60 minutes).
    * A button to toggle automatic refresh on/off.
* **Alert System:**
    * Ability to set a percentage threshold for price change alerts (default 5%).
    * Notifications when a coin's price changes by more than the set percentage (both for increases and decreases):
        * Sound notification.
        * Windows system tray "balloon tip" pop-up notification.
        * On-screen `MessageBox` with detailed information and "BUY/SELL" suggestions.
        * The corresponding coin card's background color changes to indicate the alert.
* **Interface and User Experience:**
    * User interface created entirely with C# code (no visual designer).
    * **Day/Night Theme Mode:** Switch between two color schemes with persistence of the last selected theme.
    * **Header Panel:** Includes a theme toggle button and a placeholder for a future menu.
    * **API Settings Section:** UI to select API source (currently CoinMarketCap only) and to input/save the API key.
    * **Minimize to System Tray:** The application window can be minimized to the system tray.
        * The window can be restored by double-clicking the tray icon or using the "Open Program" option from its right-click context menu.
        * The context menu also includes an "Exit" option.
* **Data Persistence:**
    * The list of tracked cryptocurrencies is saved when the program closes and reloaded on startup.
    * The selected theme mode is saved.
    * The entered API key is saved.
* **Chart Area:**
    * An internal chart area to display price information for the selected cryptocurrency.
    * Currently, the chart shows a simple trend line based on available percentage change data from the CoinMarketCap API (e.g., 24h, 7d, 30d changes).
* **Custom Application Icon:** For the application window and the `.exe` file.

## Planned Features & Improvements (For Future Versions)

* **Language Support:** Multi-language interface (e.g., Azerbaijani, English, Russian).
* **Advanced Theme Options:** More color schemes or user-customizable theme options.
* **Comprehensive Charting:**
    * Fetching **real, detailed historical price data** (OHLCV) from APIs (CoinMarketCap if possible, or alternatives like CoinGecko) to display more informative and interactive charts (e.g., candlestick charts).
    * User-selectable time intervals for charts (e.g., 1D, 7D, 1M, 1Y).
    * Possibility to add simple technical analysis indicators (e.g., Moving Averages).
